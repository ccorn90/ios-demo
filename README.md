The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate of various iOS concepts and some gotchas.  It is part of a portfolio for the author.  Includes sample network manager with effective wrapping of NSURLConnection.

PLEASE NOTE: The license is GPL 2.0 for a reason.  You agree that if you use the contents of this repository, you will publish your relevant source code in the same manner.  So DON'T copy-paste this code into a product.  Learning is very welcome, however.  Notice how I structured my code, how I handled errors, and where I wrote "TASK" instead of "TODO" to indicate issues that would need to be resolved before taking this to prod.

tl;dr : This is a portfolio repo, it's GPL (!) and you're encoraged to learn, not copy.
